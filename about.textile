	<div class="entrybody">
My name is Claudio. I’ve been working with computers for 25 years, doing with them almost anything that can be done with a computer. I like robots and shakuhachi.

I’m currently doing a lot of web development, and I’m happily working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails.

I’m the cofounder and lead developer of "sidirect":http://sidirect.net, a international platform for the real estate market.

When I got some free time, I like to hack new features in "echowaves":http://echowaves.com, our amazing “group chat social network”.

I’m married with "this beautiful woman":http://raquelquinto.com and we have a son called "AKIRA":http://www.echowaves.com/conversations/221.
