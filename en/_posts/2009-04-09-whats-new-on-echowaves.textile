Over the past weeks we have been adding some new things to "EchoWaves":http://echowaves.com, we are working on writing a small guide that lists all the features of the application, and show examples of use, meanwhile, there are the new features: 

h4. Favorite conversations

Now, next to the title of each conversation, you can see a small star, if you click on the star you can make the conversation "favorite." In the menu there is also a link (a star icon) from which you can access the list of your favorite conversations with a single click 

h4. Mute notification of new messages

In the menu there is now an icon of a speaker, click on it, and you can silence or activate the sound notification of new messages

h4. Better URLs

The URLs of the conversations and user profiles now include the title of the conversation and the name of the user respectively, my profile would be:
"http://www.echowaves.com/users/51-crossblaim":http://www.echowaves.com/users/51-crossblaim
and the URL of my photo log would be:
"http://www.echowaves.com/conversations/119-crossblaim-photolog":http://www.echowaves.com/conversations/119-crossblaim-photolog
